# Decentralized-Voting-System

This repository contains a smart contract-based decentralized voting system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The system allows for transparent, tamper-proof voting processes with features such as candidate management and vote tracking.

**Features:**
Candidate Management: Owners can add candidates to the voting list.
Voting Period Control: Set start and end dates for voting periods.
Voting Logic: Allow users to vote only during active voting periods and ensure votes are only cast once per user.
Visibility and Data Retrieval: Get candidate details and voting status.
**Technologies:**
Solidity: For smart contract development.
Truffle Suite: For development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.
Ganache: For local blockchain simulation.
